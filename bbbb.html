		<!-- Background -->
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			Boulder Boat Betting Battle was created for an assignment about
			affordances in USC's Introduction to Game Design class.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each design team was given an object, and had to make a game
			based primarily on the affordances of that object. 
		</p>
			<h3>We were given a set of plastic boats.</h3>
			<img src="img/boats.png"/>
		<p>
			The boats floated easily in water, which was an affordance
			we all noticed pretty quickly, but I pointed out that the
			boats had space to put small objects in, and that they would
			sink if they got too full.
		</p>
		<h3>From then on, we were set on making a game about sinking boats.</h3>
		
		<!-- Challenges -->
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>From the start, B.B.B.B. had a small set of rules that
			really compelled playtesters to keep playing and enjoy it.
			Our problem was figuring out how to turn these mechanics which
			people already loved into actual progress towards winning or losing the game.
		</p>
		<h3>The main challenge was to figure out how the player should be
			punished or rewarded for the bets they place during gameplay.
		</h3>
		
		<!-- Gameplay -->
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<p>To start, the game box is filled with water.</p>
		<img src="img/filling-tub.png">
		<p>Then, everyone picks a boat and floats in the water.</p>
		<h3>All players then grabs a cup and a pile of rocks, and
			round 1 begins.</h3>
		<p>In each round, players hide a secret number of rocks under their cup.</p>
		<img src="img/hidden-rocks.png">
		<p>Then, one player makes a bid, guessing the 
			total number of rocks under all the players cups.
		</p>
		<h3>A bid of "eight" for example, means that that player thinks
			there are <em>at least</em> eight total rocks under all the cups.
		</h3>
		<p>Players go around making bids until someone thinks the last bid was too high.</p>
		<p>Once this happens, everyone reveals their rocks, and the total
			number is counted.
		</p>
		<h3>If the last bid was higher than the total...</h3>
		<p><em>The last bidder</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;takes the difference between their bid and
			the real number, and puts that many rocks in their boat.
		</p>
		<h3>If the last bid was lower than the total...</h3>
		<p><em>The person who stopped the bid</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;takes the difference between the last bid and
			the real number, and puts that many rocks in their boat.
		</p>

		<h3>Players are slowly eliminated until only the winner remains!</h3>
