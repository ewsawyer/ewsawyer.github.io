		<!-- Background -->
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Serious Business is a concept that I pitched to my Introduction to Game Design class as a sophomore
			which was voted by the class to be one of four pitches turned into a final project.
		</p>
		<p>3 of my classmates joined me, and I stayed on as lead designer.
		</p>
		
		<!-- Challenges -->
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<h3>Serious Business changed drastically from its original state,
			in which it was more of a memorization game than anything else.
		</h3>
		<p>
			The biggest challenge was to create tensions between players 
			that would motivate them to make stock trades in the game, which we accomplished
			by distributing crucial information about the prices of these stocks
			between the players. 
		</p>
		<h3>Everyone knows a little bit, but only collectively
			(and at the end of the round) is the full financial picture revealed.</h3>
		
		<!-- Gameplay -->
		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		<p>You must make frantic stock market trades with your
			friends, turn every event to your advantage, and
			deceive everyone at the table into giving up their best
			cards.
		</p>
		<img class="article-img" src="img/sb-contents.png" />
		<p>The game consists of two types of cards, <strong>Events
		</strong> (on the left) and <strong>Stocks</strong> (on the right)
		</p>
		<p>Each round, players will get 4 <strong>Stocks</strong>
			and 1 <strong>Event</strong>. Your Event, along with all the other
			players' Events, determines the value of your Stocks
			at the end of the round.
		</p>
		<h3>Here's what a round looks like when it's all set up:</h3>
		<img class="article-img" src="img/sb-setup.png">
		<p>At the bottom, we've got our hand (which we'll keep secret from everyone else).</p>
		<p>In the middle is a common pool of 6 Stocks that we can swap at any time with the ones in our hand.</p>
		<h3>Once players have their cards, the 60-second trading frenzy begins!</h3>
		<p>If your event card indicates that a particular stock will be worth a lot (or nothing at all)
			you'll need to trade out your worthless cards for the good ones
		</p>
		<p>Watch your rival traders though! If someone is snatching up all the stocks in a certain category,
			chances are it's going to be worth a lot at the end of the round.
		</p>
		<h3>Keep your wits about you and try to suss out the best trades!</h3>
		<p>Once the 60 seconds of trading conclude, <strong>choose which 1 of your 4 Stocks you want to sell</strong> (collecting multiple stocks of the same company is encouraged, since you can sell all of them at once for extra profit).</p>
