			<h1 class="game-title">Juice Box</h1>

			<p>My goal with this prototype was to take a single action and make it as juicy and satisfying as possible while only using simple 2D shapes.
			</p>
			
			<p>My first challenge was to pick an action, and I settled on a game where the player could use their mouse to shoot at falling metal cans. It seemed like promising ground because of how intense the impact of a bullet with a metal can could be, and how many fun sounds I’d be able to incorporate.
			</p>

			<p>After an hour implementing the core mechanic of shooting cans and tuning the physics until it felt right, I went straight to the gamefeel.
			</p>

			<p>In total, I made 15 different effect types, 10 of which are triggered every time the can gets shot:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The can flashes</li>
				<li>Paint splatters appear behind can</li>
				<li>Sound of shot being fired</li>
				<li>Sound of can being hit</li>
				<li>Slow motion</li>
				<li>Lens distortion</li>
				<li>Chromatic aberration</li>
				<li>Particles from shot</li>
				<li>Camera shake</li>
				<li>The can expands slightly before shrinking in size</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If I had to keep only 3 of them (not counting sound effects), it would be the paint splatters, the camera shake, and the slow motion. 
			</p>

			<p>The slow motion actually ended up being a crucial game mechanic: hitting one can would slow down all the others and allow you to chain together more hits if you were fast. It was so important I actually extended its duration when the player got the last hit on a can, which made them choose to hit cans in specific orders and lent a tiny bit of strategy to an otherwise purely mechanical game.
			</p>

			<p>At the end of the project I took all the effects code I wrote and compiled it into a little library. It’s definitely not clean enough for the Asset Store but it’s perfect for me when I’m trying to quickly add juice to something, and I used it in many future prototypes.
