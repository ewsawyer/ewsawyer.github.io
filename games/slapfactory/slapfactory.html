			<h1 class="game-title">Slap Factory</h1>

			<p>Slap Factory is a 1-button game where you follow ridiculous rules to perform quality checks at a shape factory.
			</p>

			<p>This prototype was inspired by <a href="https://papersplea.se/">Papers Please</a>, and the comically nightmarish experience of trying to read parking signs here in DC.
			</p>

			<img src="parking-sign.jpg" width=350 alt="A ridiculous parking sign in dc with many conflicting rules">

			<p>I wanted to make something that emulated the exact feeling of trying to parse a bunch of self-contradicting rules while stopped in the middle of rush-hour traffic, desperate to park your car for less than $30.
			</p>

			<p>In Slap Factory, you need to keep up with the rules behind you and mash the spacebar a few times to slap away objects that violate those rules before they get past you. If you mess up three times you lose your job.
			</p>

			<p>To recreate the panicky feeling of being stopped in a busy one-way road trying to figure out if your car will be towed away, I made the game increasingly absurd and contradictory as the levels progress.
			</p>

			<p>
				To prevent the gameplay from getting stale, I decided to think outside the box (ha) and bring in rules that had nothing to do with the factory, like "what day is it?" and "how do you spell 'monday'".
			</p>

			<p>
				My goal was to catch people completely off-guard and create a moment where it feels like their brain is short-circuiting, at which point <strong>they will truly understand what it's like to park your car in the nation's capital.</strong>
